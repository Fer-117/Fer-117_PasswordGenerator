## Description
The purpose of this project is to creat a website that can generate a secure password for you to use. 
After you input the desired length of your password, it will ask you through a series of prompts what characters you want included in your password. You can select from lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers and symbols.

## Technologies
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
  
There is little HTML and CSS on this page since the goal here was to create an algorithm with JavaScript that
generates a password based on user preferences. It was definitely a challenge since most tutorials I found on 
the internet didn't meet the requirements for the password I wanted to create. Once I was able to store the user's
preferences in the password, I was able to apply an algorithm to shuffle the order of the password I had generated.
